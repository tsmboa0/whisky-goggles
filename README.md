### 1️⃣ The CLIP Engine: Visual Intelligence

The CLIP engine leverages OpenAI's powerful vision-language model:
- **Embedding Database**: Pre-embedded collection of 500+ high-quality whisky bottle images
- **FAISS Similarity Search**: Lightning-fast vector search identifies visual matches
- **Confidence Scoring**: Sophisticated algorithm assigns reliability scores to each match

### 2️⃣ The OCR Engine: Textual Precision

The OCR pipeline extracts and processes text with domain-specific optimizations:
- **Custom Preprocessing**: Specialized image enhancement for whisky label clarity
- **Text Extraction**: EasyOCR with fine-tuned parameters for bottle text
- **Noise Reduction**: Advanced filtering of irrelevant text and OCR artifacts

### 3️⃣ The LLM Mediator: Intelligent Decision-Making

The LangGraph-powered mediator is the breakthrough component that elevates WHISKY-GOGGLES beyond existing systems:
- **Decision Engine**: Analyzes and weighs evidence from both pipelines
- **Domain Expertise**: Incorporates whisky-specific knowledge to resolve ambiguities
- **Confidence Assessment**: Provides realistic confidence scores based on evidence quality

### 4️⃣ BM25 Metadata Retrieval: Precision Matching

Unlike systems that rely on fuzzy matching, our precision-focused BM25 implementation ensures:
- **Exact Brand Matching**: Distinguishes between similarly named whiskies
- **Detail Preservation**: Captures age statements, cask types, and special editions
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Returns rich information about each identified bottle

## 🚀 API Endpoints 

WHISKY-GOGGLES offers two powerful endpoints:

### `/recognize` - Direct Image Upload

### `/recognize_url` - accepts image url


### Response Format
